                    <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
                <P>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx 
                 (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus 
                 Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern 
                 Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities 
                 formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.
                 he gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia,
                 where the current population of the species is estimated 
                 at 373,000 individuals.</P>

                <p>Gemsbok is light taupe to tan in color, with lighter 
                  patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails 
                  are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends 
                  from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through 
                  the juncture of the shoulder and leg along the lower 
                  flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear 
                  leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their 
                  legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front 
                  f both the front legs, and both genders have long, straight 
                  horns. Comparably, the East African oryx lacks a dark patch
                  at the base of the tail, has less black on the legs 
                  (none on the hindlegs), and less black on the lower flanks.
                  One very rare color morph is the "golden oryx", in which the 
                  gemsbok's black markings are muted and appear to be golden.</p>
